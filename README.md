# Ai-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Java-

## Intro
This game was an assignemt where we had to use java to create and object oriented tic tac toe game using classes. The bonus for the assignment was to add in ai to attack and defend against opponents. I ended up finishing the assingment early and decided to also create a Gui version of the game where you click buttons instead of inputing the location of the move.

## How it works 
There are two game modes
### game mode 1 
is in the terminal and looks like

### game mode 2
second uses Java Swing to make a Guy version of the game with buttons and looks like

# # Warning GUI version is extremely slow and the AI vs AI option may crash
If the gui program begins to open multiple tabs or freezes you can just type 

```bash
control c 
```
and it will kill the program.

Both game modes have three options
### option 1 Human vs Human w
here two people can play against each other
### option 2 Human vs Ai 
where you can play against the computer
### option 3 Ai vs Ai 
where you can watch the computer play against itself to try and win.

# # How to run
must be in the folder in terminal
### 1. compile all the code
```bash
javac *.java
```
### 2. to run game mode 1 
```bash
java tictactoe.java
```
### 2. to run game mode 2 
```bash
java maingui.java
```
